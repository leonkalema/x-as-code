## 1. Introduction

This document describes the Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) implemented by {{ data.meta.company }} in compliance with UN Regulation No. 155 (R155). The CSMS establishes processes, policies, and controls to ensure appropriate cybersecurity measures throughout the vehicle lifecycle.

## 2. CSMS Overview

The {{ data.meta.company }} CSMS is structured to ensure that cybersecurity is addressed throughout the organization, development process, and vehicle lifecycle. Our approach is based on the following principles:

- Security by Design
- Defense in Depth
- Least Privilege
- Regular Assessment and Improvement
- Comprehensive Risk Management

## 3. Organizational Structure

The cybersecurity governance structure is as follows:

- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Overall responsibility for cybersecurity
- Vehicle Cybersecurity Team: Implementation and monitoring of vehicle security
- Product Development Teams: Integration of security in development
- Incident Response Team: Handling of security incidents

## 4. Risk Management Process

The risk management process follows ISO/SAE 21434 and includes:

{% if data.threats %}
### 4.1. Identified Threats

| ID | Threat | Risk Level | Controls |
|----|--------|------------|----------|
{% for threat in data.threats %}
| {{ threat.id }} | {{ threat.name }} | {{ threat.risk_level }} | {{ threat.mitigations | join(', ') }} |
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## 5. Security Controls

{% if data.controls %}
The following security controls have been implemented:

| ID | Control Name | Description | Status |
|----|--------------|-------------|--------|
{% for control in data.controls %}
| {{ control.id }} | {{ control.name }} | {{ control.description }} | {{ control.status }} |
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## 6. Security Testing and Verification

Our verification approach includes:

- Static Code Analysis
- Dynamic Security Testing
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Compliance Checking

## 7. Incident Response
