# Automotive Security: UN R155 as Code

> *"Cybersecurity compliance through code means systematic, repeatable, and verifiable security measures."*

## What is UN R155?

UN Regulation No. 155 (R155) establishes requirements for cybersecurity management systems (CSMS) in vehicles. It requires manufacturers to implement a systematic risk-based approach to cybersecurity throughout the vehicle lifecycle.

## R155 as Code Approach

This directory contains examples and templates for implementing R155 compliance as code, including:

- Automated security risk assessments
- Codified cybersecurity controls
- Validation pipelines for security requirements
- Compliance documentation generation
- Supply chain security verification

## Key Components

| Component | Description | Example Tools |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Threat Modeling | Automated threat modeling and risk assessment | TARA templates, STRIDE models, threat-dragon |
| Security Controls | Codified implementation of security controls | Security as Code templates, policy enforcement |
| Compliance Checks | Automated validation of R155 requirements | Compliance frameworks, security scanners |
| Incident Response | Codified incident response procedures | Playbooks as code, response automation |
| Documentation | Automated generation of cybersecurity documentation | Documentation as code, compliance reports |

## Examples

- `/threat-models`: TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) as code
- `/security-controls`: Implementation of security controls
- `/compliance-validation`: Automated validation of R155 requirements
- `/documentation`: Generation of compliance documentation
- `/incident-response`: Automated incident response procedures
