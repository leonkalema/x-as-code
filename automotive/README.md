# Automotive-as-Code

> *"Modern vehicles are computers on wheels - their configuration, behavior, and features should be defined as code."*

## What is Automotive-as-Code?

Automotive-as-Code refers to the practice of managing automotive systems, configurations, and development processes through declarative code rather than manual processes. This approach brings software engineering best practices to vehicle development and operations.

## Key Components

| Component | Description | Example Tools |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Vehicle Configuration | Define vehicle features, parameters, and ECU configurations as code | AUTOSAR, Vector tools, AutoCoding |
| OTA Updates | Manage vehicle software updates through code-defined pipelines | Uptane, Eclipse hawkBit, OTA Connect |
| Testing Infrastructure | Define simulation environments and test scenarios as code | Carla, LGSVL, Gazebo |
| CI/CD for Automotive | Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for vehicle software | Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions |
| Digital Twins | Vehicle digital twin definitions and simulation environments | Azure Digital Twins, AWS IoT TwinMaker |
| Compliance Verification | Automated verification of safety standards (ISO 26262, ASPICE) | ANSYS, Vector tools, LDRA |

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent vehicle configurations across fleets
- **Traceability**: Track changes to vehicle configurations over time
- **Automation**: Reduce manual errors in vehicle software deployment
- **Safety**: Improve safety through automated testing and verification
- **Collaboration**: Enable team review of vehicle software changes
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting vehicle configurations

## Examples

The subdirectories contain examples for different aspects of Automotive-as-Code:

- `/vehicle-config`: Examples of vehicle configuration as code
- `/ota-pipelines`: Code-defined OTA update pipelines
- `/simulation`: Simulation environments defined as code
- `/safety`: Safety verification automation
- `/ci-cd`: CI/CD pipelines for automotive software

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/x-as-code.git
cd x-as-code/automotive

# Explore examples for your specific need
cd vehicle-config   # Or any other directory
ls -la

# Try out examples with your own automotive project
cp -r examples/your-platform/* your-project/
```
