# Network Security as Code

This directory contains examples of implementing network security using code-based definitions, including Kubernetes NetworkPolicies, AWS Security Groups, and service mesh configurations.

## Overview

Network Security as Code involves:

1. **Defining network boundaries and isolation** through code
2. **Controlling traffic flows** between application components
3. **Implementing least-privilege access** at the network level
4. **Automating compliance** with network security standards

## Examples

- [Kubernetes NetworkPolicies](./kubernetes) - Examples of Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources
- [AWS Security Groups](./aws-security-groups) - Defining AWS Security Groups using Terraform
- [Service Mesh Policies](./service-mesh) - Security policies using Istio service mesh
- [Firewall as Code](./firewall) - Cloud firewall configurations as code

## Best Practices Demonstrated

These examples follow security best practices:

1. **Default deny** - Start by blocking all traffic and then allow only what's necessary
2. **Microsegmentation** - Create fine-grained security zones
3. **Explicit egress controls** - Restrict outbound traffic as well as inbound
4. **Version control** - Track all network policy changes
5. **Automation** - Apply network policies through CI/CD pipelines
