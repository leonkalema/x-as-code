# Security as Code

Security as Code (SaC) is the practice of incorporating security controls, policies, and compliance requirements directly into the development and deployment pipeline through code rather than treating security as a separate, manual process.

## Core Principles

1. **Automation**: Security checks, scanning, and enforcement are automated and integrated into CI/CD pipelines
2. **Declarative**: Security policies and requirements are defined as code in a declarative format
3. **Version-controlled**: Security configurations are stored in version control alongside application code
4. **Testable**: Security requirements can be tested as part of automated test suites
5. **Shift Left**: Security is integrated early in the development lifecycle rather than as an afterthought

## Common Implementations

- **Infrastructure Security Policies**: Using tools like Terraform Sentinel, AWS CloudFormation Guard, and OPA/Rego to enforce security standards in infrastructure
- **Container Security**: Using tools like Trivy, Clair, and Anchore to scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Secret Management**: Using tools like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and external secret operators in Kubernetes
- **Compliance Validation**: Using tools like Chef InSpec, Open Policy Agent, and custom scripts to validate compliance with regulatory standards
- **Network Security**: Using network policies, service meshes, and firewall-as-code solutions
- **Identity & Access Management**: Defining roles, permissions, and access controls as code
