# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual processes or interactive configuration tools.

## Key Benefits

- **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure over time
- **Consistency**: Deploy identical environments every time
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention and human error
- **Documentation**: Code serves as documentation for the infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Easily scale infrastructure by modifying code

## Popular Tools

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

### AWS CloudFormation

[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) allows you to model your entire AWS infrastructure as code.

```yaml
Resources:
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: WebServer
```

### Pulumi

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) uses programming languages instead of YAML or domain-specific languages.

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const instance = new aws.ec2.Instance("webServer", {
    ami: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
    instanceType: "t2.micro",
    tags: {
        Name: "WebServer",
    },
});

export const publicIp = instance.publicIp;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use version control**: Store IaC files in Git or another version control system
2. **Modularize**: Break down infrastructure into reusable modules
3. **Use variables**: Parameterize your code to make it reusable
4. **Implement state management**: Properly manage state files (e.g., Terraform state)
5. **Implement testing**: Test infrastructure changes before applying them
6. **Use CI/CD**: Automate infrastructure deployment through CI/CD pipelines

## Examples

Check out the infrastructure examples in the repository:

- [AWS Basic Web Application](https://github.com/yourusername/x-as-code/tree/main/infrastructure/examples/terraform/aws-basic-web-app)
- [Multi-Tier Architecture](https://github.com/yourusername/x-as-code/tree/main/infrastructure/examples/terraform/multi-tier)
- [Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/yourusername/x-as-code/tree/main/infrastructure/examples/pulumi/k8s-cluster)

## Integration Points

Infrastructure as Code integrates with:
- Configuration as Code (to configure provisioned resources)
- Security as Code (to ensure infrastructure security)
- Policy as Code (to enforce organizational policies)
- Compliance as Code (to maintain compliance)
