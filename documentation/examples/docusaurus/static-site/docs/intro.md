# Introduction to X-as-Code

Welcome to the X-as-Code documentation site! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of examples and best practices for implementing various "as-code" methodologies in modern software development and operations.

## What is X-as-Code?

X-as-Code refers to the practice of defining and managing various aspects of software systems using code and declarative configuration files, rather than manual processes or GUI-based tools. This approach enables:

- **Version Control**: Track changes over time
- **Repeatability**: Ensure consistent environments and operations
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention and human error
- **Collaboration**: Enable team members to review and contribute
- **Testing**: Validate changes before implementation
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting systems and processes

## Key Domains

The X-as-Code repository covers several key domains:

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Define and provision computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

### Policy as Code
Define and enforce organizational policies using code.

```rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  image := input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
  not startswith(image, "approved-registry.com/")
  msg := sprintf("image '%v' comes from untrusted registry", [image])
}
```

### Configuration as Code
Define and manage system configurations using code.

```yaml
- name: Ensure web server is running
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

### Security as Code
Define and enforce security controls using code.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: aws-iam-admin-policy
    message: IAM policy grants admin access
    severity: WARNING
    match:
      - Statement[].Effect == "Allow"
      - Statement[].Action[*] == "*"
      - Statement[].Resource[*] == "*"
```
