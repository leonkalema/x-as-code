# X-as-Code Documentation

Welcome to the X-as-Code documentation. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and collection of examples for implementing various "as-code" practices in modern software development and operations.

## What is X-as-Code?

X-as-Code refers to the practice of defining and managing various aspects of software systems using code and declarative configuration files, rather than manual processes or GUI-based tools. This approach enables version control, repeatability, automation, and collaboration.
