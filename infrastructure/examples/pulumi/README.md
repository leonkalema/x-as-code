# Pulumi Infrastructure as Code Examples

This directory contains examples of infrastructure as code using Pulumi, which allows you to define infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and others.

## What is Pulumi?

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and manage cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Unlike YAML or domain-specific languages, Pulumi enables you to use the full power of a programming language, including loops, conditionals, functions, classes, and package management.

## Examples

- [AWS Serverless Application](./aws-serverless-app/): A complete serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

## Key Benefits of Pulumi

- **Use Real Programming Languages**: Define infrastructure in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, C#, F#, and more.
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Works with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and many other providers.
- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable infrastructure components using classes and functions.
- **Integrated Testing**: Test your infrastructure code with familiar testing frameworks.
- **State Management**: Maintain infrastructure state securely in Pulumi's service or in your own backend.
- **Policy as Code**: Define organizational policies and enforce them during deployments.

## Getting Started

To run these examples, you'll need to:

1. [Install the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
2. Configure your cloud provider credentials
3. Change into the example directory
4. Follow the instructions in the example's README.md
