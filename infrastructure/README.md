# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual processes or interactive configuration tools.

## Key Benefits

- **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure over time
- **Consistency**: Deploy identical environments every time
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention and human error
- **Documentation**: Code serves as documentation for the infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Easily scale infrastructure by modifying code

## Popular Tools

- **Terraform**: Cloud-agnostic infrastructure provisioning
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific infrastructure provisioning
- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure as actual code (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
- **Azure Resource Manager**: Azure-specific infrastructure provisioning
- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: GCP-specific infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible**: Configuration management with infrastructure capabilities
- **Kubernetes manifests**: Container orchestration definitions

## Examples

Examples will be organized by tool and use case, demonstrating best practices for infrastructure deployment, management, and maintenance.

## Integration Points

Infrastructure as Code integrates with:
- Configuration as Code
- Security as Code
- Policy as Code
- Compliance as Code
